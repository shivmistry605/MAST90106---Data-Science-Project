# Optimizing ETL process for unstructured geoscience data 
Group 3 : Optimising ETL (extract, transform, and load) process for unstructured geoscience data into a predefined data model.

The goal of this project is to find a semi-automated data entry process which helps to bring “real” unstructured geological data into a structured and queryable form.  Lithodat are translating and cleaning huge data tables via scripts into a digestible format which is then stored in their database and can be analysed on the fly via Lithosurfer.The problem is that there is a lot of that data comes in various input formats.

The task is to find and evaluate and test ETL solutions and document the process of using it with sample datasets provided by Lithodat.

## Client Requirements
* Only Software based ETL tools to be tested as the end solution to be used by geo-scientists
* Software tools should have user-friendly UI/UX
* Software tools should pass the ETL Tests
